This repository is intended for storing and managing dotfiles, scripts, and configuration files to help automate and standardize my personal development environment.

It's provided as reference for anyone who would like any part of it for their own environment.

## Using these dotfiles
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/johnlettman/dot.git
    cd dot
    ```
2. **Review the contents** and customize to your needs.
3. **Install it:**
    ```sh
    ./.install.sh
    ```

## Naming Scheme
To keep everything organized, I use the following naming scheme:
- `@` prefix: machine-specific dotfiles
- `_` directory: root-level dotfiles
- all others are named without the `.` prefix to differentiate repository files
  and proper dotfiles
